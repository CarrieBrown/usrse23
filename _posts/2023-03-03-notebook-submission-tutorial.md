[Submission of computational notebooks](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/submissions/notebooks/) are due Monday, May 1, 2023. To account for the broad variety of use cases for notebooks, we are accepting submissions in three categories, described in detail on the [the Notebooks Submissions](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/submissions/notebooks/) page. Submitters should use our [notebook templates](https://github.com/USRSE/notebook-templates) to submit. In order to improve the clarity of our expectations, we are hosting a tutorial session. We will walk through the technical details of using our templates to submit a notebook in R or Python. As this is our first year accepting notebook submissions, we anticipate this being a productive session with lots of Q&A. This session will be recorded for reference.
