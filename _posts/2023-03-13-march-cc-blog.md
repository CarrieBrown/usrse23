The theme of the US-RSE March Community Call was "Computational Notebooks as Scholarly Objects."
Computational notebooks are now an essential component of the research software ecosystem,
supporting a variety of use cases across many disciplines. As a way to acknowledge
their established role in our community, the US-RSE 2023 conference committee has
decided to introduce a dedicated submission track for notebooks. But what does it mean
to “submit a notebook” to a conference? Kenton, from the Program Committee, will give
a history of similar efforts to elevate notebooks as scholarly objects. Then Ludovico,
Torin, and Nicole, from the Notebook Subcommittee, will summarize their findings from
the notebook submission development process and present the submission workflow in its
current form. A key part of the call will be the discussion with the audience: not only
to solicit feedback about the conference submission process (did we cover all reasonable
use cases? did we leave something out?), but more broadly about the growing importance
of notebooks as not only research tools, but as first-class artifacts of the
software-driven discovery process.
