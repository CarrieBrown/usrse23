## Get Involved with pyOpenSci! Building diverse community around scientific Python open source software through peer review, training and mentorship

pyOpenSci is building a diverse community around the Python open source
software that drives open science. Attend this BoF session to learn about
submitting a Python package to pyOpenSci's open peer review process, and
how you as a research software engineer will benefit from our supportive
review process. You'll also learn about best practices for pure Python
packaging that are documented in our guide that we've recently updated with
significant input from maintainers of Python packaging tools, core scientific
packages and the broader community.

Founded in 2018, pyOpenSci's core program is open peer review of scientific
software with the goal of improving the quality, usability, discoverability
and long-term maintenance of scientific packages. We also focus on diversifying
the community through both community partnerships, and support for communities
that have not been traditionally a part of the Python open space but who have
interest in participating. Through our partnership with JOSS (Journal of Open
Source Software), we also offer a publication win-win to maintainers who are
interested in both Python modern best practices, long term community support
and also formal publication of their software.

Community is core to our organization. As such understanding the needs of 
esearch software engineers working in the scientific Python space is critical
as we develop our organization's structure, programs and goals.

In this BoF session, we will discuss and ask for feedback on four things:

1. We will review our open peer review process and how you can submit a package to us for review.
1. We will talk about our community governance and how we are actively engaging with a variety of communities with the core goal of diversifying the Python open source space.
1. We will answer questions and get feedback on our process to ensure that we are supporting research software engineers that are working on Python tools.
1. We will talk about the community work that we are doing to create useful Python packaging and contributor resources that support modern approaches to Python packaging

This BoF will be relevant to anyone interested in US-RSEcon 2023's theme
enabling software, because pyOpenSci is empowering a diverse community to drive
open science forward by building Python open source tools. The format of this
session will be a mixture of short "how to" overviews followed by discussion
sessions that solicit feedback.

## Notebooks as a Possible Future for Scientific Publication, Better Practices for Sharing Software, and RSE Authorship

Software is now a key part of just about all scientific research and as such
the need to support this need within science has gotten a lot of attention. One
area of particular interest by funding agencies, such as NSF who invest in
scientific software development, is that of sustainability and reusability
so as to maximize the gains from these investments from research funds. One
approach to scientific software sharing and reusability is that of utilizing
computational notebooks as the paper itself, with it as the peer reviewed
scholarly object. Such an effort was leveraged by the NSF EarthCube program
n the last 3 years as a means of not only making software investments within
geoscience more discoverable and reusable, but to also motivate the community
itself to go through the needed effort of documenting and packaging their
software in this manner through the peer review process which carries weight
within academic reward systems. Given its success here the AGU put in and was
awarded a grant from the Sloan Foundation to carry this further, bring together
publishers and other stakeholders to work out the details as to how publications
can actually be transition such that notebook submissions might actually replace
paper submissions where appropriate and still be indexed, discovered, and
accessed with existing publication systems and processes.

Computational notebooks are also increasingly important tools for research and
science communication as they can be used to teach, showcase tools, communicate
research results, and provide friendly interfaces to interact with data and
software. To this end, US-RSE’23 Conference accepted submissions for reproducible
notebooks (that were rendered to HTML documents), and interactive notebooks
(that were hosted on Binder). Drafting a rubric for better practices was
exceptionally difficult for interactive notebooks which are, by definition, not
fully-reproducible due to widgets or other expected user-inputs. In addition,
all software inevitably becomes unrunnable without maintenance. How then,
should we ensure the reproducibility of our notebooks? And should this be a
lasting or ephemeral goal? These are open questions the notebook subcommittee
had to reckon with as they formulated better practices for peer review and we
feel that they are worth opening up to the RSE community at large.

We propose to bring together a Birds of a Feather at US-RSE’23 to introduce
these efforts as an area of interest for RSEs as well as explore the state of
things right now and the areas that still need to be worked out. The format of
the BoF will be in the form of a panel followed by a menti driven discussion
with the audience. The panel will consist of representatives from notebook and
notebook tool (e.g. binder) providers, AGU, and members of the US-RSE’23
notebooks subcommittee to discuss where each is going in terms of
supporting/using notebooks.
